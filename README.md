Traffic Collisions within Los Angeles Pre and During COVID-19
  
## Scope
  In March of 2020, the novel coronavirus spread throughout the country, resulting in widespread stay-at-home orders. As the stay at home order continued, people began searching for ways to move about in a socially distant manner, including active transportation modes, such as walking and biking. The creation of slow streets helped encourage active transportation by designating safer areas that were car-free. While this mode shift occurred, fewer people were commuting daily resulting in fewer cars on roads and more vehicles speeding. Together, these transportation shifts create the possibility for greater traffic collisions between vehicles and pedestrians, and cyclists.
   
   Previous work has shown that traffic incidents occur in a small percentage of the overall road network typically occuring in lower-income communitites. However, since the start of the COVID stay-at-home order, we are curious to see if this relationship between traffic accidents and locations has changed when compared to pre-COVID levels. This analysis is critical, especially with some slow streets becoming permanent, to ensure the safety and efficiency for pedestrians and cyclists. We hope to visualize the difference between collision severity, whether the collision involved a pedestrian or cyclist, and number of collisions per month (or week) against demographics in the county. 
  
  For this analysis we are focusing on Los Angeles County, separtating by zipcodes for countywide maps, and separating by census tract when displaying specific parts of the county. Using these spatial scopes will allow us to factor in demographics to determine if there are any relationships. 

## Data
As for data sources,  
1. [CHP Statewide Integrated Traffic Records System (SWITRS)/Census Shape Data](https://www.chp.ca.gov/programs-services/services-information/switrs-internet-statewide-integrated-traffic-records-system) 

    This dataset allows us to track traffic collisions in the Los Angeles County Area

2. [Census Data](https://data.census.gov/cedsci/)

    This dataset allows us to crosscheck demographics with the collision data. 

## Conclusion
