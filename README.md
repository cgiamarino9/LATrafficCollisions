Traffic Collisions within Los Angeles County Pre and During the COVID-19 Pandemic
  
## Scope
  In March of 2020, the novel coronavirus spread throughout the country, resulting in widespread stay-at-home orders. As the stay-at-home order continued, people began searching for ways to move about in a socially distant manner, including active transportation modes, such as walking and biking. The creation of slow streets (residential streets that have been marked with temporary barricades and signage to reduce traffic flow) encouraged active transportation by designating safer areas that were car-free. With this mode shift occuring and combined with the stay-at-home orders encouraging people to work from home if possible, there was a decrease in daily commuters. However, with fewer cars on the road, data has shown that there has been an increase in reckless driving, such as speeding. Together, these transportation shifts create the possibility for greater traffic collisions between vehicles and pedestrians, and cyclists.
   
   Previous work has shown that traffic incidents occur in a small percentage of the overall road network, typically occuring in lower-income communities. However, since the start of the COVID stay-at-home order, we are curious to see if this relationship between traffic accidents and locations has changed when compared to pre-COVID levels. This analysis is critical, especially with some slow streets becoming permanent, to ensure the safety and efficiency for pedestrians and cyclists. We hope to visualize the difference between collision severity, whether the collision involved a pedestrian or cyclist, and number of collisions per month (or week) against demographics in the county. 
  
  For this analysis we are focusing on Los Angeles County, separtating by zipcodes for countywide maps, and separating by census tract when displaying specific parts of the county. Using these spatial scopes will allow us to factor in demographics to determine if there are any relationships. The maps will use demographics as a base layer, using a color gradient to demonstrate demographical differences, and pinpoint locations of collisions using a three-dimensional component. 

## Data
As for data sources,  
1. [CHP Statewide Integrated Traffic Records System (SWITRS)/Census Shape Data](https://www.chp.ca.gov/programs-services/services-information/switrs-internet-statewide-integrated-traffic-records-system) 

    This dataset allows us to track traffic collisions in the Los Angeles County Area

2. [Census Data](https://data.census.gov/cedsci/)

    This dataset allows us to crosscheck demographics with the collision data. 

## Conclusion
With this data, we expect to confirm the relationship between traffic collisions and lower-income and disadvantaged communties. We also predict a slight increase in collisions due to cars traveling at higher speeds and the increase of pedestrians/cyclists. Through this project, we hope to gain an understanding of whether designated slow streets can improve safety by reducing collisions or if the number of incidents near designated slow streets will increase (approx. 1/2 mile to 1 mile radius). Using our findings, we hope to provide policy recommendations to create a safer active transportation network.
