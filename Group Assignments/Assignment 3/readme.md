# Week 4: Mini Group Assignment

## Project Title: Analyzing Traffic Collisions Pre and During the COVID-19 Pandemic 
## Link to Proposal: [Located here](https://github.com/natam1/LATrafficCollisions)
## Roles: 
### Natalie: Pandemic Crash Professional (COVID-19 Data, 3/19/2020 onwards)
- Analyze traffic data
- Create maps/charts
- Conduct data exploration for variables during COVID-19

### Karen: Collision Historian (Pre-COVID-19 Data, up until 3/19/2020)
- Analyze traffic data
- Create maps/charts
- Conduct data exploration for variables pre-COVID-19

Each group member will develop and create a series of charts/maps for their given data assignment (pre/during COVID-19). 

## Status Update:
Overall, the mood is buzzy. We have a good idea of what we'd like the project to be, and we're piecing it together day by day. We communicate well, and the workload is evenly divided between the two of us. We are in the midst of finalizing our data sources and the charts/maps that we would like to create. 

## Data Update: 

We have located a dataset, updated in October of this year, that contains weekly collision data. 
* Traffic Accidents by Date: [Located here](https://data.lacity.org/A-Safe-City/Traffic-Accidents-by-date/2mzm-av8t) <Br>

We also plan to use Census Data, taken from [Social Explorer](https://www.socialexplorer.com/tables/ACS2018_5yr). We will use the data to analyze census tracts in Los Angeles, CA.


## Concerns: 
There should be a lot to be concerned about at this phase of the project. List those concerns and classify them as "Major concerns" and/or "Minor concerns." <br>

* Still finalizing what maps/charts we would like to illustrate for our midterm project. We have a lot of different ideas, but need to be able to apply them and have a map/chart as a result (minor concern) <Br>
* Need to finalize/trim data sources and if working separately/tag-teaming, may need to use same file (minor concern) <Br>
* Need to review the rubric/items for Final (minor concern)
* Overlaying traffic collision data with census tract shape file
